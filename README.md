# Spirit Design System
This repository contains two projects:
* [library](https://github.com/JDRF/spirit/tree/master/library) - the UI components that are distributed as an NPM package, and the test pages for each component
* [doc-site](https://github.com/JDRF/spirit/tree/master/doc-site) - the public-facing documentation site 

Refer to the README for each project for information on how to run the projects locally.
