      # Card

      <p class="spirit-long-form-text__subhead">Cards are a concise and scannable grouping of information, used as an entry point to more detailed content. Spirit cards come in various types and sizes, and can be used in many contexts. They are laid out in analogous decks, using a card grid.</p>

      ## Anatomy
      
      <img src="/images/card/card-anatomy@2x.png" style="max-width: 492px;" alt="Anatomy of a card" />

      Title and Action are the only required elements.
      
      ### Image
      Helps differentiate cards and supports a card’s title. Use a 16:9 aspect ratio and keep the photo’s subject in the vertical and horizontal center of the frame. Some CSS cropping may occur at certain viewport sizes. 
      
      ### Title
      Briefly summarizes the content.
      
      ### Description
      Optionally provides additional text to clarify or establish the content. Should not contain formatting or links. Avoid using a description when the title is sufficiently obvious.
      
      ### Action
      Accommodates a single action, typically a link to more detailed information. Visually, all actions in a row are vertically aligned.

      ## Sizes
      Cards can be scaled according to the total amount of cards, resulting in 2-4 columns and 1 or many rows. Text and images scale with the overall card and are not independently configurable. The height of the cards in a row is determined by the tallest card’s height. The default card size (medium) is recommended for most situations.

      ## Card Grid
      Cards are arranged in a grid with consistent card heights in each row. They are ordered from left to right, with the first card positioned at the top left. The number of cards per row is determined by the size of the cards and adapts to the available screen real estate (up to 4 on larger screens, and down to 1 on smaller screens).

      <img src="/images/card/card-grid-desktop.png" alt="Card grid preview with six cards in rows of three" />

      The example above is an image. View a <a href="card-grid.html">full-screen preview</a> of card grid.

      As in this example, include two invisible placeholder cards to prevent the card grid from stretching orphaned cards unpredictably. 

      ### Responsive Layouts
      Cards can be presented in various ways on extra small screens: stacked (default), as a list, or in a carousel. 

      #### Stacked
      By default, cards stack into one column.
      <img src="/images/card/card-mobile-stack@2x.png" style="max-width: 439px;" alt="Anatomy of a card" />

      #### List
      Cards can be shown in a list view to make comparisons across cards easier on small screens.
      <img src="/images/card/card-mobile-list@2x.png" style="max-width: 439px;" alt="Anatomy of a card" />

      #### Carousel
      Cards can be displayed in a carousel when the content of each card is unrelated to the others and needs no comparison. Use Spirit’s demonstration-only Javascript as a starting point for wiring up the carousel in your product. 
      <img src="/images/card/card-mobile-carousel@2x.png" style="max-width: 439px;" alt="Anatomy of a card" />

      ## Guidelines

      ### Use When
      
      Presenting multiple, easy-to-compare options.

      #### Do not use when
      
      Listing hierarchical or alphabetical options such as people, teams, donors, donations, events, or chapters. Use [List](/components/list.html). 

      ### Visual Language
      
      Use a consistent arrangement of elements for every card in a card deck. For example, if some cards have an image and others don’t, consider using placeholder images or text cards, to keep the cards balanced and consistent.  

      ### Editorial

      #### Titles

      * Make titles concise and scannable.
      * Set clear expectations about the card’s purpose.
      * Avoid using punctuation such as periods, commas, or semicolons. 

      #### Descriptions
      
      * Use full sentences with punctuation.
      * Do not include multiple paragraphs.

      #### Calls To Action
      
      * Keep action labels terse. One or two words is ideal.
      * Lead with a strong verb that encourages action.
