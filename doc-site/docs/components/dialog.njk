        <h1>Dialog</h1>

        <p class="spirit-subhead">Dialogs focus the user’s attention on a single task or piece of information and often require decisions. They appear over the interface and block further interactions.</p>
        <p>Dialogs are disruptive intentionally and should be used thoughtfully and sparingly depending on the informational context and/or need.</p>
        <p>Dialogs depend on Javascript. We are leveraging [A11y Dialog](https://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-dialog/) within the Spirit design system to run the dialogs. See [Guidelines - JavaScript](#javascript) for information javascript usage and the necessary dependencies.</p>

            <p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that strikes both children and adults suddenly. It has nothing to do with diet or lifestyle. There is nothing you can do to prevent it. And, at present, there is no cure.</p>
            <p>In T1D, your pancreas stops producing insulin—a hormone the body needs to get energy from food. This means a process your body does naturally and automatically becomes something that now requires your daily attention and manual intervention.

            <p>However, insulin is not a cure for diabetes. Even with the most vigilant disease management, a significant portion of your day will be spent with either high or low blood-sugar levels.

        ## Anatomy

        <img src="/images/dialog/dialog_anatomy.png" style="max-width: 524px;" alt="Anatomy of a dialog" />

        ### Content
        The dialog contains three primary elements. First, the `.spirit-dialog` container with a unique dialog id. Second, the `.spirit-dialog__overlay` container to display a darkened background behind the dialog. Third, the `.spirit-dialog__content` container that has within the visual content of the dialog.

        ### Header (optional)
        The header `.spirit-dialog__header` is the first element within the `.spirit-dialog__content`. Within this header, a `.spirit-dialog__header-title` is required. Optionally, a container `.spirt-dialog__header-icons` can be used to house a close or other action [Icon Only](/components/buttons.html#icon-only) buttons.

        ### Close Button (optional)
        When a close button is used, it is an [Icon Only](/components/buttons.html#icon-only) button. Depending on the dialog type (see below), the close button can either be the first element within the `.spirit-dialog__content` and displayed outside the dialog content area, or can be within the `.spirit-dialog__header` (see below). The close icon has attribute `data-a11y-dialog-hide` and `aria-label=”Close Dialog”` and uses the Spirit `x` icon .

        See [A11y Dialog DOM API](https://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-dialog/#dom-api) for more references on closing and opening the dialogs.

        ### Body
        The dialog’s primary content is always contained within the `.spirit-dialog__body` element.

        ### Footer (optional)
        An optional `.spirit-dialog__footer` is used primarily with Modals to house buttons. The footer is always visible with longer content scrolling underneath.

        ## Behavior

        ### Positioning
        Dialogs appear in the center of the screen and above all other elements.  If the dialog contains dynamic content that will cause it to change height, pin the dialog to the top of the screen with `.spirit-dialog__content-top`.  Pinning will provide a smoother user experience by providing an visual anchor point while the dialog content grows or shrinks.

        ### Trigger
        A trigger (i.e. button, card, other interactive element) can be used to trigger the display of a dialog. To automatically target the dialog by clicking on the trigger, the trigger must have the attribute `data-a11y-dialog-show="dialog-id"` containing the unique id of the targeted dialog container (`.spirit-dialog`). For other methods of triggering the dialog, see [Guidelines - JavaScript](#javascript).

        ## Simple

        Simple dialogs display information that the user needs to be aware of concerning their current task but does not require actions for the user to take.

        * Dismiss dialog by clicking the close button, pressing the escape key, or clicking outside the dialog.
        * If a title is used, it is recommended to give the title a unique ID and add that ID to the `.spirit-dialog__content` container as `aria-labelledby=”title-id”` to enhance accessibility UX.
        * The title will be truncated to one line (unless dialog is an [Alert Dialog](/#)).

        * Footer is required with buttons that trigger the close of the dialog or an explicit action determined by the event. These actions require custom coding. See [Guidelines - JavaScript](#javascript) for further guidance.

        ## Alert

        An alert dialog is used primarily to confirm actions that can’t be undone, such as discarding unsaved changes. The alert dialog, due to its importance and intended lack of content, has a unique set of styles from the other dialogs. Custom modifier classes for padding and sizing do not apply to the alert dialog.

        ## Sizes

        Dialogs can be scaled to fit their contained content strategically. Other than the `fullscreen` size, dialog sizing sets the `max-width` of the dialog. Dialog sizes do not apply to alert dialogs.

        ### Small (Default)

        ## Guidelines

        ### Use When

        Dialogs are invasive and should be used sparingly. The ability of the user to access and view the primary content is the primary focus of a positive user experience.

        ### Editorial

        * Limit the number of interactions within a dialog. Remove elements or content that do not support the task.
        * Avoid complexity within a dialog such as tabbed interfaces, internal navigation, etc.
        * Using multiple methods of dismissal is encouraged, but using both the [close button](#close-button-optional) and a cancel or close button in the dialog footer are not required.
        * Dialog titles should be short and concise (if used). Dialog titles will be truncated to one line (unless an alert dialog).

        ### Visual Style

        Fix the dialog to the top of the screen with `.spirit-dialog__content-top` if the dialog contains dynamic content to prevent the dialog from jumping positions on the screen (see below for class reference).

        ### Accessibility

        Dialogs, by definition, trap focus. That means if a user presses Tab or Shift+Tab while their keyboard focus is in the dialog, their focus should stay inside the dialog and cycle through the dialog’s content.

        * Use the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `.spirit-dialog__content` component to target the dialog header (if exists). 
        * Use the inherited logic, structure from the [A11y Dialog](https://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-dialog/) component, including the following:
            * Trap focus inside dialog when dialog opened
            * Focus on first focusable dialog child element when opened

        ### Markup

        #### Expected Keyboard Interactions

        * `Escape` key or clicking outside the dialog closes the dialog and moves focus to whatever triggered the dialog to open (unless the dialog is a modal dialog or alert dialog).
        * When a dialog is opened, focus is placed on the first focusable element in the dialog.
        * `Tab` key used at the bottom of the dialog cycles focus back to the first focusable element at the top of the dialog.
        * `Shift + Tab` keys used at the top of the dialog cycles focus back to the last focusable element at the bottom of the dialog.
        * `Enter` key submits the dialog’s form data - if applicable.

        ### JavaScript

        We are using the 3rd party scripts for the [A11y Dialog](https://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-dialog/) component to construct our dialogs. See [Getting Started](/getting-started.html) for more information on using 3rd party libraries.

        As with other Spirit components, the JavaScript used for dialog is used to illustrate functionality. Spirit adopting teams may reference [this example](https://github.com/JDRF/spirit/tree/develop/library/components/dialog/dialog.js) and write their own JavaScript for their products. As with other scripts used in Spirit, they are included in the Javascript Bundles found in the Getting Started guide.

        Any custom UX (i.e. modal dialog actions) will need to be custom coded per dialog usage. For guidance on custom events, callbacks, etc, see the [A11y Dialog](https://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-dialog/) documentation.

        Currently, [A11y Dialog](https://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-dialog/) does not support nested dialogs. If needed, see recommended modifications to the [A11y Dialog](http://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-dialog/#implementations) scripts or crafting custom JavaScript by adopting teams to achieve the interactions needed.

        Adopting teams may work with dialog components that are not in the DOM and/or inject dialog content via an api. This is expected and will require custom scripts crafted by adopting teams to achieve desired results. 

        If using custom scripts, be sure to adhere to [accessibility](#accessibility) recommendations. Minimally, dialogs should replicate accessibility standards found in the [A11y Dialog](https://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-dialog/).

        [React and Vue](http://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-dialog/#implementations) implementations for A11y Dialog are also available.

        ## Code Reference

        ### Markup

        * Due to current issues with Chrome and the `<dialog>` component, use `<div role="dialog">` or `<div role="alertdialog">` as shown in examples above.
        * Dialogs either have a `role="dialog"` or, if a modal or alert dialog, `role="alertdialog"`.
        * Use `role="alertdialog"` instead of `role="dialog"` for Modal or Alert dialog types to prevent the dialog from closing using the escape key or clicking outside the dialog.
        * The dialog has an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true` unless the dialog is open.
        * If a title is used, it is recommended to give the title a unique ID and add that ID to the `.spirit-dialog__content` container as `aria-labelledby="the-title-id"` to enhance accessibility UX.
        * See the [Close Button](#close-button-optional)
        * Add `data-a11y-dialog-hide` attribute to `.spirit-dialog__overlay` to allow hiding the dialog by clicking on the overlay. This is included in the examples above.
        * Use a unique dialog id to trigger dialog effectively.
